# Exploratory Data Analysis â€“ Hospitality Dataset

This project is a guided exploratory data analysis (EDA) assignment I completed while learning data science. It focuses on uncovering insights from a hospitality dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## What It Covers
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualizing trends in bookings, cancellations, and revenue
- Drawing actionable insights from the dataset

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with real-world data, and strengthened my understanding of core EDA concepts.
